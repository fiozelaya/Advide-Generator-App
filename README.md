## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

In this exercise I mostly learned about the ways I can use grid to layout the contents of the page. Placing that button and divider in the right place was definetely a challenge!


### Useful resources

- [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/css/) - This helped me a lot to keep the CSS properties I needed in hand.
